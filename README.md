# HealthLearning(That's the Expression) This app was made fo ConUhacks2019 Hackathon held in January 2019
This is an app to help diagnose patients with asperger's syndrome with the help of computer vision.
Our project is a learning application to help Asperger Syndrome patients by testing them in different situations. 
It is divided into two parts wherein the 
first part is for testing a patient's emotions with the random images, and 
in another part, we are taking one small quiz on fix interval during learning to check its response.
